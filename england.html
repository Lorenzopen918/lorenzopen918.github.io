<p class="par">A somewhat surprise team in this years World cup Quarter finals, as England have been notorious for choking on the round of 16. This years "Three Lions" squad as they are called have shown remarkable quality to reach this stage.The squad they have this year shows a lot of potential, promise, and fighting spirit that the previous squads lacked. With stars such as Raheem Sterling, Dele Alli, Harry Kane and rising youngsters like, Jesse Lingaard, Marcus Rashford, and Jordan Pickford, just to name a few, the English squad look to have a decent chance of takin the trophy home this year
<br><br> 
This will be England's 15th appearance in the tournament finals. coming in as 12th place in the world rankings they have taken top spot in their group to comfortably qualify for this year's finals, England look set to add on to their win championship from 1966. Many doubts have been cast especially towards the new Manager, Gareth Southgate, as this will be his frist major tournament managing the senior side, but South gate has already shown his winning potential with his decent friendly record leading up to the world cup where he managed to keep both Brazil and Germany to a nil-nil draw.
